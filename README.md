This is a reimplementation of the wordle game at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.  I've made two important changes.



1. Allow repeated game play instead of one game a day.
2. Allow word lengths greater than 5.

As a consequence of the second point, I'm also allowing the user to configure the number of guesses.  While I think the original designer mad a great choice in allowing 6 guesses for a 5-letter word, it will take experimentation to determine good choices for longer words.  Also, one might want to use this game to teach spelling to a child, and more guesses would be needed.

This is very much a work in progress.  In particular, I haven't generated the word lists for lengths greater than 5.  I've downloaded the Big English Word Lists from https://www.keithv.com/software/wlist/index.php, and I'm working on it.
